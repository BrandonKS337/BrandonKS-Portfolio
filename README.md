This Repository Project is a personal portfolio website for myself used as a fun way to show off my skills in a quick simple way. It is deployed through Vercel using a Custom DNS purchased elsewhere and utilizes Next.js as well as motion-framer and Tailwind CSS. It was a ton of fun to make and very flexible in implementing quick changes thanks to its dynamic components. Below is default setup information if you would like to mimic the project as the design is open source and fair use anyway. Happy coding friends!



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
